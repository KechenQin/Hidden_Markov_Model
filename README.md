# Hidden_Markov_Model

<h2>Discrete hmm:</h2>
A simple implementation of discrete hidden markov model includes calculating forward algorithm, viterbi algorithm and supervised learning. The observations are words and the states are part-of-speech tags. The accuracy of this example is near 90%.

<h2>Continuous hmm:</h2>
An example of using ghmm package includes calculating likelihood, decoding and learning.
